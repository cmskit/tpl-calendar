# cms-kit template calendar

This template lets you create/view/manage resource-calendars (events grouped by resources) and also normal calendars.
You can even define recurring events (with -in the future possibly- exceptions).
Of course you can have multiple views like day, week and month.
Editing events is done via the default template.


It makes use of [FullCalendar ResourceViews](http://tux.fi/~jarnok/fullcalendar-resourceviews),
an extension of [FullCalendar](http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar) whitch is dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.


Used as *normal calendar* all entries in a given period are shown

A *resource-calendar* can for example be usefull to show/organize events for staff-members
but could also be used to manage the occupation of rooms, hardware (eg. laptops), etc..
